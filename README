These directories contain a number of sample files that were used to performed
the simulations in Schannwell et al 2019: "Kinematic response of ice-rise
divides to changes in ocean and atmosphere forcing". The work is published in
the journal the Cryosphere.

1. The InputFiles directory contains a inputfiles such as bedrock topo etc that are
needed for Elmer.

2. The UserFunctions directory contains a couple of customised userfunctions
that were used in the simulations.

3. The directories SMBPerturbation and ShelfPerturbation contain sample sif
files for the SMB perturbation runs (Runs 3-5 in the paper) and the no shelf
perturbation runs (Runs 7-9 in the paper).

To use these sif files for simulations in Elmer a corresponding mesh file will
also be necessary. Rather than being able to use these files out-of-the-box in
Elmer/Ice, these files should provide some help for future users.
